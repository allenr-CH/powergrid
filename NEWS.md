# powergrid 0.4.0
- Omitted all settings of par(), including graphics::layout() (PowerPlot and GridPlot)
- Argument shades_legend removed as argument to PowerPlot. The related function
  to add a legend to the grey scale is omitted too. This legend is difficult to
  position without setting par. Also, the use of such legend is very limited,
  since the eye is notoriously bad in seeing the equality or difference between
  shades when they do not share a border. (PowerPlot)
- Omitted (conditional) set.seed() in PowerGrid. This seed was set for cases
  where there happens to be no .Random.seed yet. Slightly tweaky circumvented by
  always drawing one uniform number before doing anything.
# powergrid 0.3.0
- performed all checks as listed in issue #55 Release powergrid 0.3.0

# powergrid 0.2.1
- only typos

# powergrid 0.2.0

This is a large, but still minor update. Some arguments have been renamed and
one function has a new name. Vignette has been improved greatly, and all
documentation has been updated and extended. Cross-referencing in Documentation
is improved. Warnings and documentation is more consistent now.

Not that this is a Beta release. Use
  `remotes::install_github("SwissClinicalTrialOrganisation/powergrid", ref =
  "v0.2.0")` to install it. The package is very soon to be sumbitted to CRAN. No
  changes at the user side are planned.
 
## Breaking Changes
* `SummarizeIterations()` replaces the older `SummarizeSims`. Iterations may,
  but must not be simulations. Language is consistency adjusted throughout the
  package. In documentation, as well as in attributes of `power_array` objects,
  "sim" is, where relevant, replaced by "iter".
* Central argument names have changed in Example, PowerPlot, GridPlot,
  AddExample and FindTarget:
  + `find_lowest` replaces `find_min`
  + `target_at_least` replaces `minimal_target`
  + `target_value` replaces `target`
* Compatibility with sse package was omitted. see is offline and is not
  updated. Keeping all working with eventual sse output was too error-prone for
  little use.

## Improvements user level
* All help files were improved
* Vignette was extended and improved
* Tests included! (thanks Richard!)
* Input handling of all functions and respective errors and warnings was
  improved.
* PowerPlot and Example naturally deal with one-dimensional `power_array`
  object. PowerPlot has a special figure to represent the one-dimensional
  situation.

## Improvements under the hood
* The plotting of examples inside `PowerPlot()` is now handled by `AddExample`.
* Summarizing across dimenstions inside `power_grid` is now performed by
  `SummarizeIterations()` (Thanks Richard!)

## bug fixes
* A multitude of bugs were fixed
